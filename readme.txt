First Hardware Ritual is the first in a series of interactive web poems. It suggests, in a whisper, that there is both an emotional and material connection between the network culture, the internet, and geological processes, and insinuates that networked computers are tangible emotional infrastructures that carry, on thick bundles of fiber optic cable, precious human and more-than-human stories.

The poetic website is a website that exists against all odds. Computers perform overwhelmingly more tasks in service of corporate use cases than in service of chat room love letters. But these moments exist in spite. Are they the signal in the noise or the noise in the signal?
